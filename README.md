# intro-MachineLearning
This repository contains projects for two Udacity Nanodegrees: Introduction to Machine Learning/AI and Machine Learning Engineer

## Chicago Bikeshare
Navigate to /chicago_bikeshare_us to find the first project, which is introduces students to Python 3.

## Boston Housing
In this project, students were required to create a basic Linear Regression model to predicts house pricing in Chicago. The CSV file with input data has been omitted due to its size. The results can be found in `report.html`

## Finding Donors
This project was structured so as to provide students with practical understanding of supervised learning models. We applied different models in order to find potential donors for charity. The results are found in its respective `report.html` file.

## Customer Segments
In this more advanced project, unsupervised learning techniques were explored. We performed data exploration and analysis, feature scaling, principal component analysis (dimensionality reduction), and finally, clustering algorithms to engineer customer segments, so as to provide our (imaginary) customer with insights about whether they should change their delivery service.
