A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",

    "**Answer:** My intuition tells me that, as `'RM'` increases, so does the value of `'MEDV'`. More rooms are likely to occupy a larger area, as well as require more material to build the house.\n",
    "An increase `'LSTAT'` probably decreases the prices of the house, as (unfortunately) a neighbourhood consisting of a high percentage of lower class people tends to increase crime rate, therefore reducing `'MEDV'`.\n",
    "`'PTRATIO'` troubles me a little. On the one hand, I am led to think that higher values increase prices, for many children studying in the neighbourhood schools might be an indicator that the schools are good. On the other hand, a very high ration might indicate saturation, meaning that schools are full, which might reduce the price. Also, some families nowadays prefer a lower ratio of students to teacher, because their kids end up getting more attention from their mentors. I am looking forward to checking the data for this one.

Choosing less then this (max_depth = 1) leads us to converge at a low score, whereas choosing hihger values (6 or 10) seems to lead to training and testing scores that do not converge. As we increase the number of training points to this model, the training score seems to show a slight decrease in the beginning, then it stabilises. The testing curve, on the other hand, shows a great increase as we go from 0 to 50, and then also stabilises. If we added more training points to the model, we might run the risk of overfitting. As the scores already seem to show enough convergence, we are OK."

    "### Complexity Curves\n",
    "The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "**Answer: ** When depth is 1, both scores are low, meaning we have high errors, which implies underfitting. Thus we can conclude we have high bias for this depth. We depth is 10, though, we seem to be overcomplicating. In other words, we are overfitting our model. We can conclude this because our training score becomes very high, but our validation score is relatively low, and shows a somewhat high variance (shaded area around the green line). In this case, we are running the risk of having high variance."

It is useful because, as we have seen in one of the classes of the course, it can be very difficult to manually choose the best parameters. The 'grid' is basically a dictionary with the possible values of parameters we want to test, and then computations are run to build models with each of the possible combinations of the dictionary. For example, we might use grid search to decide on the maximum depth of a decision tree."

This type of validation is good because it prevents us from using too much data as our training set, which could lead to overfitting. Without running the risk of mixing training and testing data.\n",
    "As some parameters of some models must be manually selected, we run the risk of tweaking the parameters for best performance. As stated in the docs, `\"knowledge about the test set can “leak” into the model and evaluation metrics no longer report on generalization performance\"`."

    "### Implementation: Fitting a Model\n",
    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

    "For the `fit_model` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.\n",
    "  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.\n",
    "  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) from `sklearn.grid_search` to create a grid search object.\n",
    "  - Pass the variables `'regressor'`, `'params'`, `'scoring_fnc'`, and `'cv_sets'` as parameters to the object. \n",

    "**Answer: ** The constructed model needs to be improved before it can be safely trusted. We could see from the previous example that our model has a range of almost 70k, which is aproximately 17% of the total value. There simply is too much fluctuation in the predictions. We would probably need more data, or maybe employ a different predictor altogether (I am not qualified enough yet to tell). \n",
    "Data collected from 1978 is really a problem. Inflation has since greatly increased prices. Also, the perceived threat of surounding poverty might not mean the same as it did then. As I mention in the previous answer, the physical conditions of the house must be factored into the decision making. It can be that, a smaller house is valued better because its conditions are better, or its area better utilised.\n",
    "We can safely state that our model is not robust enough. The example above of the 17% fluctuation for a single client is too high.\n",
    "Even though the features of houses might hold similar correlations to the final price regardless of being in an urban or rural city (i.e., poor neighbourhood negatively impacts price, good public schooling positively does so), the model would likely be inadeqate for a rural area. Baseline prices are probably very different, due to differences in supply and demand dynamics. Moreover, slight differences in the 'weights' of each feature might lead to very different outputs.\n",
    "It is very difficult to address fairness matters. From the standpoint that people are willing to pay more to feel safer, meaning safety must be paid for (very controversial), one could argue that yes, it is. Ideally, we should not be so scared so as to be willing to pay so much more money looking for a 'better' neighbourhood. However, though I do not agree with paying for safety, I do acknowledge that we cannot discard the larger context, for we do not live in isolation. "
