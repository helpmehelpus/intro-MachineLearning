# Capstone project
This folder contains work for the capstone project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network model was implemented to detect the presence (or absence) of a certain species of cactus in sets of images.

The `proposal.pdf` file contains the project proposal. The `capstone.ipynb` contains the code that was implemented for the project. The `report.pdf` file contains a thorough report of the process, detaling the methodology, metrics, results and final considerations.

As there are too many files in the dataset, the data is not explicitly present in this repository. The files can also be downloaded from Kaggle via the link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/13435/download-all.
The link to the Kaggle competition is https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification/overview

All the libraries used in the Anaconda environment that has been created are present on the `requirements.txt` file.

To setup the project's environment, create an environment that uses Python 3, and then run `pip install requirements.txt` to install all the dependencies. After that, all it takes is to run `jupyter notebook capstone.ipynb` and run the code.
